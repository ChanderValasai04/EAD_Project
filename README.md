## The Pomodoro Timer app is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique, which structures work and rest sessions to improve focus and reduce mental fatigue. The app allows users to set and track focus intervals (default 25 minutes), short breaks (5 minutes), and long breaks (15 minutes) with a visually engaging interface, animated progress indicator, and sound notifications. Optionally, session history tracking provides insights into daily productivity.
